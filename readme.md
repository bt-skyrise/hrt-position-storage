# Helsinki Region Transport position storage

A simple .NET console app that subscribes to high-frequency vehicle positioning MQTT broker from Helsinki Region Transport and stores all events in MongoDB.

Live data from HRT is used in [Real-time Map](https://github.com/AsynkronIT/realtimemap), which is a [Proto.Actor](https://proto.actor/) library showcase. [Proto.Actor](https://proto.actor/) is a cross-platform actors solution for .NET and Go.

The purpose of this app is to gather some events in case HRT stops publishing them in the future (so the [Real-time Map](https://github.com/AsynkronIT/realtimemap) can still be run).

Possibly this repo will contain a second app for publishing previously collected events.
